# Abacus

### Purpose
Abacus is designed to provide a simple, usable, and powerful discrete math library written in Swift.
The short term purpose is to refresh my knowledge on implementing data structures and algorithms, but the long term purpose is to
create a versatile library for others to use.

### Implemented
**NOTE:** Abacus is still in active development and very early in the process. Therefore, implemented features are likely to change 
and may be partially incomplete.

* Undirected Graph
 * Add/Remove Nodes/Edges
 * BFS
 * DFS

### Planned
* Directed Graph
* Graph Algorithms (for Directed and Undirected)
 * Dijkstra
 * MST (Prim, Kruskal)
* Trie
* Heap
 * Fibonacci
 * Binary
* Other useful structures

### Possible
* Abstract Algebra concepts
 * Groups
 * Rings
 * Fields
* Matrices
* Equation solving
 * Linear
 * Differential
 
### Suggestions
Any suggestions on features are always welcome.
